# Scalop
Yet another option parser for Scala, but this one is incredibly simple and rich enough in features to satisfy most needs.

## Build Instructions
In order to build the corresponding artifacts, you must install [Java 1.6](http://www.java.com/en/download/index.jsp) or
higher and [Maven 3.0](http://maven.apache.org/download.cgi) or higher. There is no need to install Scala, as the compiler and
runtime are automatically downloaded by Maven.

In the root directory `scalop`, the following command will build the project and install in your local Maven repository:
```
mvn install
```
